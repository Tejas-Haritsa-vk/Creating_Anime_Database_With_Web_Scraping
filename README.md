## Introduction

### What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is an automated method used to extract large amounts of data from websites. The data on the websites are unstructured. 
Web scraping helps collect these unstructured data and store it in a structured form.
Some other words used for Web Scraping are: Web Crawling, Web Data Extraction, Web Harvesting, etc.

After Hearing all that the next question on anyone's mind would be
### Is Web Scraping legal?
In general Web Scraping by itself is not illegal afterall you can scrape a website for educational purposes.
As a general rule of thumb any data obtained from webscraping from sites that do not allow web scraping cannot be used for commercial purposes as it results in violation of law and is therefore illegal.
To know whether a website allows web scraping or not, you can look at the website’s “robots.txt” file. 
You can find this file by appending “/robots.txt” to the URL that you want to scrape.
eg. “https://....YOUR URL HERE..../robots.txt”

  
 
Now with that out of the way lets get into it.
